This tool cannot replace medical judgment or diagnose heart attacks, it cannot and should not replace immediate medical attention. Real heart attack presentations vary widely between individuals, and some women experience no symptoms at all (silent heart attacks),symptoms can evolve over time; a low initial score does not guarantee the situation won't become emergent. This scoring system does not account for individual risk factors such as age, family history, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, smoking status, or prior cardiac history.The symptom weights are based on general population (collected from publishesd information from the NHS and British heart foundation) data and may not apply equally to all demographic groups
