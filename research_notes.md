## Gender Approach Decision

**Decision**: This app focuses exclusively on female heart attack symptoms.

**Justification**: 
Women experience heart attacks differently from men, with atypical symptoms 
(nausea, jaw pain, fatigue) being more common than the "classic" chest pain 
presentation. Research shows women are 50% more likely to be misdiagnosed 
during a heart attack (Source: BHF, 2023). By focusing solely on female 
symptoms, this tool can provide clearer, more relevant guidance without 
diluting the message. A female-focused tool also aligns with the project's 
core aim: raising awareness of under-recognized symptoms in women.

**Scope note**: Male symptoms could be added as future work for comparison, 
but this would require separate weighting systems and research, which is 
beyond the scope of this Silver project.


*typical male symptoms of a heart attack*:
    chest pain – a feeling of pressure, heaviness, tightness or squeezing across your chest (often describes by male patients as aggressive and unbearable pain)
    pain in other parts of the body – it can feel as if the pain is spreading from your chest to your arms (usually the left arm, but it can affect both arms), jaw, neck, back and tummy
    feeling lightheaded or dizzy & sweating &shortness of breath
    feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting)
    an overwhelming feeling of anxiety (similar to a panic attack)
    coughing or wheezing
    -from the NHS

*Gender differences, symptoms commonly reported by women*:
        -chest pain or discomfort in your chest that comes on suddenly and doesn't go away. It may feel like pressure, tightness or squeezing. The pain or discomfort may spread to one or both of your arms, or may spread to your neck, jaw, back or stomach
        -shortness of breath or difficulty breathing with or without chest discomfort(THIS CAN CAUSE MISDIAGNOSIS)
        -feeling dizzy, light-headed or faint
        -feeling sick, indigestion, being sick
        sweating or a cold sweat
        -a sudden feeling of anxiety that can feel like a panic attack
        -a lot of coughing or wheezing.


Where they interlace: pain or discomfort in your chest that occurs suddenly and doesn’t go away

pain that may spread to your left or right arm, or to your neck, jaw, back or stomach. For some people the pain or tightness is severe, while other people just feel uncomfortable

feeling sick, sweaty, light-headed or short of breath.

**The problem:** statistics on misdiagnosis and delayed treatment in women. 
-1st citation. "women are 50% more likely than men to be given incorrect diagnosis following a heart attack"(BHF Press Office. 30/08/2016)
research, carried out at the University of Leeds, using the UK national heart attack register MINAP, found that overall, almost one third of patients had an initial diagnosis which differed from their final diagnosis.
Dr Chris Gale, Associate Professor of Cardiovascular Health Sciences and Honorary Consultant Cardiologist at the University of Leeds, who worked on the study, said:

"We need to work harder to shift the perception that heart attacks only affect a certain type of person. Typically, when we think of a person with a heart attack, we envisage a middle aged man who is overweight, has diabetes and smokes. This is not always the case; heart attacks affect the wider spectrum of the population – including women."

-2nd citation: "heart attack gender gap is costing women lives"(julia baker. 30/09/2019)
Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan, our Associate Medical Director, said:

“Heart attacks have never been more treatable. Yet women are dying needlessly because heart attacks are often seen as a man’s disease, and women don’t receive the same standard of treatment as men. The studies detailed in this briefing have revealed inequalities at every stage of a woman’s medical journey. The reasons for this are complex to dissect. Together, we must change this.” 

Unaware: Women often delay seeking medical help, which can reduce their chance of survival. A global systematic review found that the average delay between the onset of symptoms and arrival at hospital for men ranges between 1 hour 24 minutes and 3 hours 30 minutes compared to between 1 hour 48 minutes and 7 hours 12 minutes for women. 

Substandard treatment: Over a ten-year period, it is estimated that more than 8,200 heart attack deaths in women in England and Wales could have been prevented if they had received the same standard of care as men. The study found women were less likely to receive standard treatments including bypass surgery and stents.  
Despite public misperceptions, twice as many women die from coronary heart disease - the underlying cause of most heart attacks – than breast cancer in the UK. 

Dr Sonya Babu-Narayan added: “The first steps to closing this gender gap include changing the public perception of women and heart attacks. The assumption that women are not at risk of heart attack is false, and has proven to be deadly.”

## Weight Justification (1-5 scale)

**Weight 5 - Strong cardiac predictor:**
- Chest pain: Classic MI symptom, highest specificity (Source: NHS, 2024)

**Weight 4 - Moderate-high predictor:**
- Radiating pain: Indicates cardiac origin when pain spreads (Source: BHF, 2023)
- Shortness of breath: Second most common cardiac symptom (Source: AHA, 2022)

**Weight 3 - Moderate predictor (often atypical):**
- Sweating: Commonly accompanies cardiac events (Source: NHS, 2024)
- Nausea: Present in 60% of female MI cases (Source: BHF, 2023)
- Back pain: More common in women than men (Source: AHA, 2022)
- Jaw pain: Atypical but documented female indicator (Source: NHS, 2024)

**Weight 2 - Possible indicator:**
- Indigestion: Can mask cardiac event, especially in women (Source: BHF, 2023)
- Anxiety: "Sense of doom" documented in 30% cases (Source: AHA, 2022)
- Fatigue: Subtle early warning, but non-specific (Source: NHS, 2024)

**Weight 1 - Weak/ambiguous:**
- Dizziness: Common in many conditions, low specificity alone (Source: NHS, 2024)
